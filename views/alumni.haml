    Events
  Every semester the Undergraduate Chapter hosts an alumni event. In the Fall semester we host Homecoming (October 26, 2013) and in the Spring semester we host Refounder's Day (date TBA). The alumni chapter (see below) also hosts events throughout the year. Check out their website or contact them for more information.
