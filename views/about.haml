The chapter focuses on the development of brothers into well-rounded men. Areas of focus among its members lay in academics, philanthropy and service, social, and brotherhood aspects.  Some highlights in the past year alone for the chapter include raising over $10,000 for Push America, a charity benefitting people with disabilities, 26 new brothers being welcomed into our fraternity, a 40-team league intramural championship in soccer, numerous social events, and brotherhood activities ranging from campouts to Iron Chef cook-offs.
