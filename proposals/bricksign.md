# Description

A brick sign for our lawn would help the appearance of our chapter house.
Such a sign would do wonders for helping us put our name out there as well 
as help out in recruitment. Potential new members would be able to see the 
sign and be able to easy recognize our chapter.

The brick sign has consistently been the project with the most demand from
the chapter members. A sign would add to our chapter in many ways.
